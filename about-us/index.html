<h3>Together, us four have worked to create Starfish. Our goal was to spread awareness and help those who wanted to act but did not know what path to follow. We have coded and created a site that gathers together volunteering opportunities and information to help humans make a positive impact on the marine life that lives and exists around us before it is too late.</h3>
